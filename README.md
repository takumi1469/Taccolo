# Taccolo - Language Learning Assistance Web Application
## What is Taccolo
Taccolo is a web application for language learning assistance. Its core functionality is to create Learning Sets: language learning material from your input, with Original Text, Translated Text and List of Words. You can edit your own Learning Sets, make Help Requests if you need help from other users with your Learning Sets, and you can comment on other users' Learning Sets.

## Where does the idea of Taccolo come from?
The idea of Taccolo came from my experience when I was learning Polish and Czech. I wanted to learn these languages with music (more specifically rap music), and videos and lyrics were available. Translators are available too. **BUT**, it took so much time to look up the meaning of words. I wanted to compare the original text, translation and meaning of each word, in the same window. Also, there was no place to store such material. The solution to those problems I had turned into this application, Taccolo.
